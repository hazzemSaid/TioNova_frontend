# TODO: Chapter UI/UX Pixel Perfect and Color Consistency Improvements

## Tasks

1. Review and adjust paddings and margins in `folder_detail_screen.dart`:
   - Header section
   - Stats cards
   - Folder info card
   - Add Chapter button
   - Chapter cards list

2. Verify and update font sizes, font weights, and font colors for all text elements:
   - Titles
   - Subtitles
   - Status chip text
   - Description text
   - Info text
   - Action button labels

3. Ensure all colors (background, text, borders, icons) match the app's color palette:
   - Use hex colors consistent with `BottomNavItem.dart` and existing styles
   - Confirm status chip colors (green, red, gray) are consistent and visually balanced

4. Refactor fixed sizes to responsive sizes where appropriate:
   - Use MediaQuery or relative sizing for paddings, margins, font sizes, icon sizes, and border radii

5. Check and adjust border radii and border colors for all containers and buttons:
   - Ensure consistent rounding and border thickness

6. Verify action buttons (Summary, Quiz, Chat):
   - Spacing between icon and label
   - Notification dot style and size
   - Background color and border radius

7. Test UI on multiple screen sizes and resolutions to ensure pixel perfect rendering

8. Document any style constants or reusable widgets for maintainability

This plan will be followed step-by-step to achieve pixel perfect and color consistent chapter UI/UX.
