# Auth Screens Web Layout Update - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary of Changes

### 1. ✅ Navigation Flow Updated
**File**: `lib/features/start/presentation/view/screens/TioNovaspalsh.dart`
- Changed splash screen to redirect unauthenticated users **directly to `/auth`** (auth welcome)
- Removed onboarding and theme selection from unauthenticated flow
- Authenticated users still go to home (`/`)

### 2. ✅ New Reusable Component
**File**: `lib/features/auth/presentation/view/widgets/auth_split_layout.dart`
- **Purpose**: Split-screen layout for web/desktop auth screens
- **Left Panel** (45%): Very dark background (#0A0A0A) containing form content
- **Right Panel** (55%): Decorative background image
- **Responsive**: Automatically uses mobile layout when width < 800px

### 3. ✅ Updated Auth Screens (Web/Desktop Only)

All screens now feature:
- **Desktop (≥800px)**: Split-screen with dark left panel, image right
- **Mobile (<800px)**: Original responsive layouts unchanged
- **Consistent Styling**: White text/buttons on dark background for desktop

#### Completed Screens:

1. **Login Screen** ✅
   - File: `lib/features/auth/presentation/view/screens/login_screen.dart`
   - Features: Email, Password, Google Sign-in, Sign-up link

2. **Register Screen** ✅
   - File: `lib/features/auth/presentation/view/screens/register_screen.dart`
   - Features: Username, Email, Password, Confirm Password, Google Sign-up

3. **Forgot Password Screen** ✅
   - File: `lib/features/auth/presentation/view/screens/forgot_password_screen.dart`
   - Features: Email input with icon, Send Reset Code button

### 4. Screens That Don't Need Updates

The following screens work well with their current responsive designs:

- **Reset Password Screen**: Already has good mobile layout, doesn't benefit from split view
- **Verify Reset Code Screen**: Special code input UI works better in centered mobile layout
- **Check Email Screen**: Information screen, works well centered

## Design System

### Colors
- **Desktop Dark Panel**: `#0A0A0A` (very dark, almost black)
- **Form Text**: `Colors.white` / `Colors.white70`
- **Primary Button**: White background with black text
- **Field Backgrounds**: `Colors.white.withOpacity(0.1)` for inputs

### Breakpoints
- **Desktop**: `width >= 800px` → Split layout
- **Mobile/Tablet**: `width < 800px` → Original layout

### Assets Required
- `assets/images/auth_background.jpg` - Background image for right panel
- `assets/images/logo2.png` - White logo for dark backgrounds
- `assets/images/logo1.png` - Dark logo for light backgrounds
- `assets/icons/google.png` - Google icon for OAuth buttons
